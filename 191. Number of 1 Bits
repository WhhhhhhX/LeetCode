Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
 it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.


class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        if (n == 0) {
            return res;
        }
        int remain = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            remain = n % 2;
            n /= 2; 
            if (remain == 1) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
