You are given an inclusive range [lower, upper] and a sorted unique integer array nums, where all elements are within the inclusive range.

A number x is considered missing if x is in the range [lower, upper] and x is not in nums.

Return the shortest sorted list of ranges that exactly covers all the missing numbers. That is, no element of nums is included in any of the ranges, and each missing number is covered by one of the ranges.

 

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower = 0, upper = 99
Output: [[2,2],[4,49],[51,74],[76,99]]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[2,2]
[4,49]
[51,74]
[76,99]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1], lower = -1, upper = -1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no missing ranges since there are no missing numbers.

//每次判断lower与数组中当前元素的大小，然后更新lower值进入下一次for循环

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findMissingRanges(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < lower) {
                continue;
            } else if (num == lower) {
                lower++;
                continue;
            } else {
                res.add(Arrays.asList(lower, num - 1));
                lower = num + 1;
            }
        }
        if (lower <= upper) {
            res.add(Arrays.asList(lower, upper));
        }
        return res;
    }
}
