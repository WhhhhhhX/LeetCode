In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.

Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.

 

Example 1:


Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

//binary search(greedy algorithm) 二分查找针对于找这种最小值或者最大值，首先可以考虑二分查找，通过逐步缩小搜索范围逼近结果
//本题中force是衡量的搜索范围，最小为1，最大为position[position.length - 1] - position[0]，然后通过求mid 的index对应的force去比较到底能不能放>= m的球

class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
        Arrays.sort(position);
        int l = 1; 
        int r = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];
        int res = 0;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            int lastPosition = position[0];
            int ball = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
                if (position[i] - lastPosition >= mid) {
                    lastPosition = position[i];
                    ball++;
                }
            }
            if (ball >= m) {
                res = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
