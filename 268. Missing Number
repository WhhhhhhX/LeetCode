Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

//Solution:

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int xor = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            xor ^= i;
        }

        for (int num : nums) {
            xor ^= num;
        }
        return xor;
    }
}
