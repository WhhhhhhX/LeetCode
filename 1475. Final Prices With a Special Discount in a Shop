You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.



class Solution {
    public int[] finalPrices(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length <= 1) {
            return prices;
        }
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        Deque<Integer> stk = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!stk.isEmpty() && stk.peekFirst() > prices[i]) {
                stk.pollFirst();
            }
            res[i] = stk.isEmpty() ? prices[i] : prices[i] - stk.peekFirst();
            stk.offerFirst(prices[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
