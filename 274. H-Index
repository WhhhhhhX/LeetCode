Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

//逻辑很简单，主要理解题意
//bucket sort, O(n)
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] bucket = new int[n + 1];
        for (int num : citations) {
            if (num >= n) {
                bucket[n]++;
            } else {
                bucket[num]++;
            }
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
            count += bucket[i];
            if (count >= i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}


//nlogn
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        if (citations == null || citations.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (citations.length == 1 && citations[0] != 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;
        int h = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (h <= citations[i]) {
                h++;
            }
        }
        return h - 1;
    }
}
