Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 


// binary search, 先判断是右半段是否ascending，如果不，最小值一定在右，left = mid + 1， 否则，最小值在左边，right = mid!!! -> [4,5,1,2,3] mid = 1， 1 < 3， 但1是最小值，所以在左边的时候right一定要等于mid，因为此时不能排除mid是否最小。

class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }   
            else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
